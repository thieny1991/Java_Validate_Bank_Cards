# Java_Validate_Bank_Cards

This is an Final Project that I worked on when I was taking Java at Richland College, Dallas, Texas.
There are terrible functions such as I passed and fstream variable into the function, which is unneccessary. 
I just realized I did that after several coding experience. 
However, this project is a very good experience with OOP programming, and very detail in documentation.
In addtion, I also used REGEX in this project. This is a very good type of project for demonstrate the usefullness of REGEX. 

This program can validate a file contains the credit card number. 
In this project, the data is stored in data.txt if one wants to check it out.
